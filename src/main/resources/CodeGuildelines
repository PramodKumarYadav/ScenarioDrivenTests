Some guidelines to follow for consistency and reducing impact due to changes:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. All Folder paths ends with a back slash "\"
    Example (In InputRoot class : private final static String Input_ROOT = "C:\\SourceCode\\MyApplication\\ftproot\\";)
    Note: A deviation will impact tests. So remember to follow this construction.
2. Leave a gap after the // in the comments.
    Example: // Here I am leaving a space after // to write a comment.
